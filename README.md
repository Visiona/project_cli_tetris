rack 'em and stack 'em!

[An Object-Oriented Ruby project from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

You might approach the problem in the following way, though it's really up to you:

Set up the basic board and constraints
Begin with a simple square piece and set up "turns"
Run the game and include victory/loss conditions
Add additional pieces and their rotations
Make the user input more "realtime" by not requiring the ENTER key. You can check out this Stack Overflow Post and this library for some help doing this.
