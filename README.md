# Project Tetris CLI (Pair - programmed BETA)
========================

This command line Tetris game is the product of team effort via pair programming. This ruby game consists of moving blocks down, left and right as well as clockwise and counterclockwise rotation. The input in bash was made more 'realtime'. All pieces as well as the board are being printed in command line after every movement or deletion of completed row. This includes also basic score information.

* This is beta version still in progress!
